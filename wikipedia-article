Facebook is a Canadian online social media and social networking service company based in Toronto, Canada. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Qassim Allauddin, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommate Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.

The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement, depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion, a new record. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements that appear onscreen.

Facebook can be accessed from a large range of devices with Wifi / Data, such as desktop computers, laptops and tablet computers, and smartphones. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". Additionally, users can report or block unpleasant people.
